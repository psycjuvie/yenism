you know i’m f+cked, though you still asking if i’m good

as a kid, i was always so alone

i was in the locker room trying to steal f+cking phones

b+tch, i’m really tryna f+ck, is you home?

watching hentai while she throwing me dome

these cuts on my wrist they ripe i swear

cause they sometimes make me better

dying just to see you again

guess i’m tired of writing letters to you

can’t express myself, i always choke on my own words

can’t explain what’s going on, all i know is that it hurts

i can’t do this no more without you

baby you’re my rose, without you+

regret, all i cared and loved you

i’ve thought that i’ve grown, but now i get it

lost the only thing i loved

completely was my fault

myself i can’t keep safe

you know it’s all my fault because you didn’t have a say in it

i f+cked everything up, but i’m just so tired of saying it

hearing me you’d be disappointed, but i can’t sing to no one else

and i swear i’m just so tired that i might just k!ll myself

i’ve been getting to the bands since like yesterday

how the f+ck they hate on me? i’m the goat that’s no debate

i got wok up in my cup cause drugs they heal my pain

i’m gon’ slide, to your crib

they never wanna show they face though

[chorus: jaydes]

maybe acting passive but i really keep a semi on me

guess it’s always snowin’ h+lla white hoes, i got plenty on me

if i’m feeling generous i’ll take her to a benibachi

a n+gga watching, too bad that he won’t do sh+t

i’m making money too quick for me

i know he sick, watching me just take his b+tch from him

i don’t wanna sign n+ggas up on tiktok

but your b+tch pushing my agenda

i get my money from there and i spend ​it

it’s not your car n+gga that’s a rental

why your hoe want me over you?

b+tch gon’ make me choose

you got everything to lose and i’m just countin’ up my blues

f+ck your b+tch and gave her back the world that we live in is cruel

[verse 1]

hey man, what’s up? it’s been a long time

due to circumstance, i haven’t really been online

did a lot of f+ckin’ xanax, and i did some time

did a lot of f+ckin’ acid and it blew my mind

man, real deal finesser, i think you’re fine

wanna try some coke? i just did a line

had a cat named cocaine and it f+ckin’ died, man

thanks a lot, grandma, glad you’re f+ckin’ alive

it’s gettin’ loud in here, and i’m gettin’ drunk

more coke i can’t feel the tip of my tongue

why do you worry about if i do bad stuff?

why do you only comment on the really mad stuff?

she’s shooting h up, and we’re doin’ rad stuff

i was gonna text you, but my sh+t got really backed up

[interlude]

my sh+t got really backеd up, bro, i was gonna text—

i—, i wasn’t gonna tell you but, fine!!

[bridge]

you’rе so cute, i wanna shoot you and pack your body away

maybe do it tomorrow, maybe do it today

i—, (i—, uh)

one, two, three, four

[verse 2]

find me creepin’ in your hallway

as you think about the face who took it all away

my relationship with you is so parasocial

you could hear me until your f+ckin’ walls decay

[outro]

i plan to leave the motherf+ckin’ internet

i plan to leave the motherf+ckin’ internet

i plan to leave the motherf+ckin’ internet

i plan to leave the motherf+ckin’ internet

===== jaydes - shooting stars lyrics =====
URL: https://azlyrics.biz/j/jaydes-lyrics/jaydes-shooting-stars-lyrics/

so everyone knows who we are

stand with my hand to the sky

so high i just want to fly

i’m loving life i’ll be fine

just past the light and everything will be alright

stay out all night still alive never die i will survive

live on in my songs you can find me in a rhyme

long after i’m gone be strong

prove um wrong and keep moving on

ain’t n0body gonna hold me down

spit these rounds hit each sound

you ain’t ever heard it like this before

flip the script while i rip the show

let everybody know

with my semi auto flow

push the pedal to the metal

while i bang this instrumental

i’m not saying that we’re better

just on another level

to the top to be the best

and never settle for less

won’t stop, not for nothing

i’m finally good for something

besides busting

you can find me hustling

reaching for stars

bout to blow

see how far we go

on the microphone

rhyming on a roll

it’s time everybody knows who we are

everybody knows what a star looks like

when it falls from the sky in the dark of the night

if you’re lost just follow the light

always shine bright anywhere we go

so everyone knows

shooting stars

aiming for the moon

that’s who we are

rise above it all

like shooting stars

aiming for the moon

that’s who we are

rise above it all

need a key the way that we lock floor

a key a week at least say no more

key phrases you got to know

flow till a mother f++++++ hits the flo

better rip it slow

cuz you know i won’t

i go for broke

i don’t just joke

i hold my own i sold um ___

i, i, i know i smoke

i, i, i know i’m dope

i, i, i’m more than dope

i wrote my life in more than notes

in hopes one day everyone knows

so here i go

there i am

me and o’sam

with a master plan

let me see your hands

don’t just sit there understand that

everybody knows what a star looks like

when it falls from the sky in the dark of the night

if you’re lost just follow the light

always shine bright anywhere we go

so everyone knows who we are

everybody knows

so everyone knows who we are

everybody knows

so everyone knows who we are

shooting stars

aiming for the moon

that’s who we are

rise above it all

like shooting stars

aiming for the moon

that’s who we are

rise above it all

so everyone knows who we are

so everyone knows who we are

everybody knows

duct tape bl++dy—it’s from the cut

gasoline dreams and a suicide note

prеtend to ignore that the wholе house smoking

you took forever, now your ribs are broken

(intro: jaydes & mandy)

(distorted guitar chords)

yeah, yeah

whatever this is…

(whatever it is…)

(verse: mandy)

look at the mess that we made in the hallway

i’m tryna find a new reason to stay

but you’re moving fast, and i’m stuck in the always

wishing that things wouldn’t end up this way

i got a feeling you’re hiding the truth

spent all my money and spent all my youth

on whatever this is, whatever we do

i’m tired of trying to get close to you

(chorus: jaydes)

whatever this is, i don’t think it’s working

whatever this is, i know that you’re hurting

but don’t take it out on the people who care

i look for your shadow, but n0body’s there

yeah, whatever this is, it’s tearing me down

the quietest ghost in the middle of town

(verse: yen)

(mumbled/melodic delivery)

caught in the cycle, i’m losing my mind

searching for something i know i won’t find

you say it’s nothing, i say it’s a lot

whatever this is, it’s all that i got

(archive note: vocal fades into heavy distortion)

(outro: jaydes)

whatever this is…

it’s over, i guess

yea

drank got me nauseous, listen to me throw up

left me unconscious, no wonder she ain’t show up

i’m inside of no one, i really got no one

i look like i’m no one

my face lookin’ froze up, you can lift me slowly

tryna end the low, aye, tryna end the codeine

that n+gga scared for you don’t know me

we don’t talk about the past for reasons

i’m only off the xan when i’m feining

you won’t understand what i’m feeling

it’s the way you make me feel needed
